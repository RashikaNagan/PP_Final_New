                Using this method, not only do the smaller tasks become less stressful but also it gives a clear definition on where the next part begins. 
                This can be done be marking on the sheet part A, B, C etc. 
                By doing this, goals can be made on a planning, creating a effective schedule.

            <div class = "tntsubcontent"> 
                Analysing the score is important to help to explore the structure of the piece, and understand the foundation of the music sheet. 
                Are there any repeats? Similar parts? Variations? This is the time to for key signature changes, observe changes in time signature and speed.

                Tip #3: Annotate the piece beforehand
                </div>
            <br>
            <div class = "tntsubcontent"> 
               It is vital to annotate the important parts of the pieces, such as the sections, whenever there are abrupt changes in keysignature, and time signature. 
               Marking with a pen, or highlighting a certain part can be extremely useful as a visual.

                Tip #4: Hand, finger, hands 
                </div>
            <br>
            <div class = "tntsubcontent"> 
                This technique consists of 3 main parts. 
                Firstly, ‘hand’ means to play a section of the piece with one hand. What do you notice? Is the fingering comfortable? 
                <br>
    
                If it isn’t, slowly go through the section with one and hand experiment with different fingerings until 1 is found comfortable. 
                This is the finger part of this effective tip. 
                Mark this on the sheet music. Really take time to explore various options of fingerings which is comfortable for you.  
                A trick for this is to always think ahead, and think where the hand is supposed to go next. 
                Think to yourself; how can I go to that next part comfortably, without lifting my hand too many times causing disruptions in the flow? 
                <br>
                Once a proper fingering is found, the last part of this tip is to play with one hand again, at a slow pace and get used to challenging parts a piece.

                Tip #5: Work on the harder passages 
                </div>
            <br>
            <div class = "tntsubcontent">
                Many pieces usually have a passage or more that can be quite challenging. But how can you overcome this? 
                There are quite a few ways, but one of the most effective ones is to break the passage into smaller sections, with 3-4 notes in each section. 
                Repeat each section multiple times seperately before slowly adding them together. 
                The important element here is to play slow, and understand the notes to get a better grip and foundation of the passage.

                </div>
            <div class = "tntsubcontent"> 
                The details in the piece are one of the most important part, these can include embelishments, dynamics, and pause. 
                Here is the time to really explore into the sheet music and see what works for you.
