        <p id = "hppergolesicontent"> Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710-1736) was an Italian composer of the Baroque era, known for his contributions to opera and sacred music. He lived a short but influential life, and his work had a significant impact on the development of the Classical style.

            The Harpsichord Suite No. 1 by Pergolesi is a collection of harpsichord pieces that showcase his skill in writing for the harpsichord, a popular instrument of the Baroque period.
            The suite typically includes a series of dance movements, each with its own distinctive character.
            <br>
            The term "Allegro" refers to a lively and brisk tempo, and it is commonly used to describe a fast-paced movement in music. 
            In the context of Pergolesi's Harpsichord Suite No. 1, the Allegro movement is likely a lively and energetic piece, characterized by its quick tempo and rhythmic vitality. 
            Pergolesi's works, including this suite, exemplify the expressive and ornamental style of the Baroque period, contributing to the rich musical heritage of the era.

        <p id = "hppergolesicontent"> 
            This piece is written on a Harpsichord, which is the invention before the piano. 
            It produces a more high-pitched sounds, and the keys are switched compared to a piano we use today. 
            This means that the white keys are on the top and the black keys are on the bottom. 
            Additionally, there are only 60 keys instead of 88 which we see on the modern piano. 
            The harpsichord, doesn't produce any dynamics (loud and soft), and doesn't have the capability to elongate notes, therefore articulation (use/manipulation of notes) was extremely important during the Baroque era.
