            In my personal project, I have chosen to learn a classical piano piece from the Baroque era; 'Allegro from Harpsichord suite No. 1' composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The Baroque era is a western style of music from the 17th century. This page reflects my journey while learning this piece, while using effective training techniques.

                    Above is the annotated sheet music for Allegro from Harpsichord suite No. 1 composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. As you can see, it is rather colorful, and each marking has it's own significance. 
                    Firstly, the piece is divided, and these divisions are marked with orange highlighter. Three different sections are used; A, B and A'. These divisions represent the ending of one section and the starting of another, which was a common structure used in the Baroque era.
                    By doing this, it helped me to plan where to take a breath logically, before continuing to the next part of the piece. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the annotations made for example are, indications of articulation which are shown with an arrow/break after a legato phrase. 
                    This was very useful for me because I was visually able to see what I am supposed to play, which is vital for a well-rounded piece.

                Here I used the hand, finger, hand method where I first play the notes with one hand a couple times for a small section (usually 1-2 lines), then I come up with a fingering for the bars that I practiced. 
                This is also marked in the sheet music, for example in page 1 in the left hand. It was a struggle for me to remember which finger I am supposed to play on certain key, so the numbers on the sheet (1,2,3,4,5) indicate which finger I use. 
                This has helped me learn the piece in a more effective manner and think about the flow of the notes rather remembering which finger I use next.

                I have encountered multiple challenges while learning the notes of this piece; for example while playing the trills. For this, I found a well-suited fingering that works for me, without using my pinky. I found that using my pinky would stop the flow, and lead to more mistakes in timing and notes.
                This is why I tried to refrain from using my pinky. As an alternative, I found another fingering by moving my hand, and using fingering (4,2,3,4); a fingering for a trill without use my pinky finger. 
                The hand,finger,hand method proved to be extremely useful here because it allowed me to find the problem, analyze the problem, and thus solve it in a organized manner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Another challenge I faced was learning the passage in bar 25 to bar 29. This was incredibly difficult for me to get on the correct timing and find a good fingering. To solve this, I used Tip #5, where I spilt the entire passage into sections by the bar. 
                With my right hand, I repeatedly played the first bar, and then played the second bar separately. 
                Once I was satisfied with each bar seperately, I combined the 4 bars together to practise the flow between the bars. The following problem I was facing is that the timing wasn't correct, and was hard to judge just by listening to me play. 
                A solution I found for this is to use a time-keeping instrument called a metronome, which gives a clicking sound on every beat. I set this to a slow tempo at first, and practiced the run with all 4 bars.
                Many trials were needed for this, however in the end, after I was satisfied with the result, I put the metronome faster. As a result, after practising with multiple speeds, I chose one that suits the requirement of the piece, which was 'Allegro'.

                Once I had mastered the difficult parts, I added dynamics, breaths and ornaments, like in the annotations shown above. I explored many ways on how to express my own music in this piece, while still maintaining the Baroque image that this piece has. 
                One of the ways I did this was using breathes to create logical endings in the piece. Another way I added to this piece, was using more emotion by having various changes in the dynamics of the piece.
